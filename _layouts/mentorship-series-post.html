    <p>Welcome to the Mentorship Series on Muya’s Blog.</p>

    <p>Here, we explore and answer questions that I’ve received from folks who are starting out on their Software Development journeys, and some further into it.</p>

    <p>We’ll be sharing my responses to the questions from mentees; as such, the views expressed here are personal, and are not meant to be canonical advice; take what you like, leave what you don’t.</p>

    <p>All the questions have been shared with consent from the mentees, and edited for privacy and clarity.</p>

    <p>I hope you learn something! Karibu 🙌🏽</p>
